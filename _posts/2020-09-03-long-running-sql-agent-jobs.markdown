SQL Agent is like Windows Task Scheduler inside SQL Server. From time to time, SQL Agent jobs run longer than expected and may need intervention to cancel or complete.

I adapted the SQL script below from the excellent Thomas LaRock original at <http://thomaslarock.com/2014/08/find-currently-running-long-sql-agent-jobs/>. I'm posting it here in the hope it might be useful for others who have similar issues monitoring SQL Server.

The script sends an e-mail if one or more SQL Agent jobs have been running longer than 30 minutes. It could be altered to suit different environments - for example, to ignore backup SQL Agent jobs, or to not send an e-mail outside of business hours, or to use a different threshold than 30 minutes.

Database Mail needs to be set up before sending the e-mail. Database Mail is a different way to send e-mails from SQL Server - a previous post of mine used PowerShell: see [E-mailing a DBA if there's SQL Server database backups run during business hours]({% post_url 2020-08-07-dba-email-business-hours-backup %}).

I prefer HTML format e-mail over plain text for tables - to display SQL Agent jobs and how long they've been running, as well as average duration.

The script should work with versions of SQL Server 2016 and later. Youâ€™ll need to substitute your own value for e-mail address (in the last line of the script). I schedule the script every 30 minutes during business hours.

The script can be tricky to test. I tested using a SQL Agent job containing a single step that does nothing for 40 minutes using `WAITFOR`.

```sql
--get currently running SQL Agent jobs that have been running for longer than 30 minutes
--adapted from Thomas LaRock original at http://thomaslarock.com/2014/08/find-currently-running-long-sql-agent-jobs/
-- 1. get currently running jobs
-- 2. leave if no running jobs
-- 3. use msdb history to calculate average duration for running jobs for comparison
-- 4. get only running jobs, that started more than 30 minutes ago
-- 5. send e-mail if any results from step #4
