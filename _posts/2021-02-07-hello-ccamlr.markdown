In January my family (wife, kids, cat and me) moved from Victoria to Hobart, Tasmania.

We were so blessed to be able to sell our house, book a moving service, buy tickets to travel, find a great house to rent close to the city, move schools, and get jobs all within 6 or so weeks.

I made the difficult decision in December, after nearly 20 years employment, to say goodbye to Peninsula Health. In that time I worked with tons of great people (too many to list here, but special mention to Apps team AKA A-Team) and learnt a lot from great leadership - Dean, who taught me to “do the best with what you’ve got”, and Mark, whose regular “what’s the worst that can happen?” has become a favorite phrase of mine. 

I’m _very_ excited to start my new role as DBA/Technical Analyst with CCAMLR ("Commission for the Conservation of Antarctic Marine Living Resources"), meet new people, learn new subject areas, and apply my data management and analytical skills to new problems.
