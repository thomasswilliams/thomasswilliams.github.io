I've worked a couple of jobs - shop assistant up to assistant manager at a hardware store over 8 years, summer jobs while studying at uni, consultant straight out of uni, then in public healthcare; first as a business analyst for 9 years and, for the past 9 years, in IT ([I blogged about my role in IT 3 years ago here]({% post_url 2017-02-01-my-day-job-2017 %})).

From all these jobs, working under lots of leaders, I've learnt it's not always possible to control the "what" and "when" of work.

However, the "how" is something I have a say in. I've built up a good idea of how I work best, my strengths and styles, and what others who work with me can expect from me.

Underlying this, it helps to be clear on what my job is: I see my job as __understanding the business (public healthcare), and solving problems__. For the business to be excellent, staff need to be excellent at their jobs - and I help them do that.

My values:

- I'm open-minded and believe good ideas can come from anyone
- I practice clear and direct communication; I model and value transparency and sharing of knowledge
- I have respect for people - their time, their knowledge & opinions
- I strongly believe in being available & accessible
- I frequently use data and evidence to support open, blame-free discussions
- I focus on outcomes - and understand there's many ways of getting to a great outcome
- I take responsibility for my tasks, processes, outcomes
