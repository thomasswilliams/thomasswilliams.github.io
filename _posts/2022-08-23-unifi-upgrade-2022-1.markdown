In this post and the next I'll be going over how I upgraded from a Ubiquiti UniFi Security Gateway (USG 3P) and original Cloud Key to a UniFi Dream Machine SE. Spoilers in advance: the upgrade didn't go as planned, and I had to start from (nearly) scratch.

I appreciate good home internet which "just works". UniFi has been exactly that; seeing the family through lockdowns, proliferating devices, streaming teenagers and 5 years of only very minor technical hiccups. As it's come time to replace some aging hardware, I planned to consolidate and modernise a couple of devices with as little fuss as possible - and maybe take advantage of new capabilities.

First, the old setup (I've previously posted about the [initial install in 2017]({% post_url 2017-03-03-home-network-unifi %}) and [added AP/switch in 2020]({% post_url 2020-03-19-unifi-update-2020 %})):

```
NBN modem
 └─ USG                 }
    ├─ 8-port switch    } UDM replacing these
    │  ├─ Cloud Key     }
    │  ├─ AP 1
    │  └─ AP 2
    └─ 8-port switch (not currently used)
```

The USG had an IP address of `192.168.1.1`, and my overall plan was to replace this with the UDM with the same address, and restore a backup from the Cloud Key to the UDM.

Before the UDM arrived, I updated the existing UniFi devices to the latest version(s); following the update, I was running UniFi Network Application version 7.2. I also took a bunch of screenshots of settings from the dashboard - just in case.

Then, I downloaded backups from the dashboard to my computer:

- `Support Information` > `Network Configuration`
- `Backup` > `Download Backup` > `Settings only`
- `Site Management` > `Export Site`

Once the UDM arrived, I plugged it from the switch to the WAN port on the UDM. I figured this was supposed to work without disrupting my existing network, however it didn't and I couldn't get internet on the UDM. Wanting to continue anyway, I unplugged the USG and plugged the UDM directly into the NBN modem. Apart from my computer - which was wired to the UDM - no-one in the house had internet. The clock was ticking!

Next I opened a browser window to the UDM default dashboard at `192.168.1.1` and applied necessary updates, ending up on Network Application version 7.2. At some point during the update, the IP address of the UDM changed to `192.168.0.1`, so I changed it back.

I should say this part of the experience was really well done. The mobile app particularly was helpful, in addition to the UDM touch screen.

So far I was about 30 minutes in to the process, and apart from no internet, all was going well.

Then I attempted to upload the backup to the UDM.
