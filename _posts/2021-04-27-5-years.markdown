5 years ago I created the first post on this blog "Starting with Jekyll".

Since then I've published 40 posts, from general topics, to developer-focused content, to more recently the ins & outs of being a DBA.

Some of my personal favourites to research, write and edit were:

- ["Tales from the trenches" parts 1]({% post_url 2020-07-31-tales-from-the-trenches-1 %}) & [part 2]({% post_url 2020-08-18-tales-from-the-trenches-2 %}) – coming clean about things I mucked up
- ["My work values"]({% post_url 2019-10-06-my-values-2019 %}) – prompted by a 9 month stint as head of a small team, lots learned and a chance to put some positive practices into place
- ["Installing PM2 on Windows"]({% post_url 2020-04-07-installing-pm2-windows %}) – a lot of the more technical posts are me battling with unfamiliar code, then emerging at the other end with a workable solution after repeat run-throughs of "I’ll just try one more thing". Due to the fast pace of change, searching the web can come up empty or incomplete. In a way, I’ve _added_ to that incompleteness by posting an answer that will eventually become out of date – but my hope is that it helps others struggling with similar challenges.
