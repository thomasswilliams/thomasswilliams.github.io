In my day job as a departmental IT worker I do a lot of stuff, from database design and queries, to server-side code in a variety of languages, to front-end design and development. I also browse the web - a lot - and look after IT at home.

With that in mind, I'd like to highlight  a couple of Chrome plugins I use regularly:

### [HTTPS Everywhere][2]
Uses https instead of http on sites that support it.

### [Adblock Plus][3]
I block ads all over the place; using OpenDNS, a HOSTS file, and in the browser. Adblock Plus wins points for simplicity.

### [WOT][1]
This is one of the first browser extensions I install on my family's computers. Shows a useful "this site is trustworthy" icon next to search results.

### [Stylish][4]
Sometimes it's nice to get a web page looking "just so". Also helps in hiding custom elements.

### [Privacy Badger][5]
Stops analytic and tracking cookies.

### [The Great Suspender][6]
"Pauses" browser tabs after inactivity.
