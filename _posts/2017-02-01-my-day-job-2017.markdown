For the last 6 years I've worked in the IT department of a hospital, with 3 main responsibilities:

- Database Administrator (DBA)
- application support and development
- Change Manager (as of mid-2016)

On a typical day, I:

- monitor systems for faults
- check the help desk system for issues logged by users
- fix stuff (yay!)
- do project work e.g. planning, implementation, testing of new systems, or upgrades to existing systems
- consult and advise in my areas of expertise
- work to improve systems
- go to meetings...OK, not my favorite
- document stuff
- help users kick a** at their jobs *(wording thanks to Kathy Sierra’s blog and [fantastic book "Badass: Making Users Awesome”][1])*

On that last point - I used to think that if IT could just be great, users would listen to us, management would appreciate us, and the world would be rosy.

A couple of things helped me re-focus and understand that IT really shines as we solve users' real problems and help __them__ be awesome at their jobs: admitting who "the talent" at any hospital is (hint: not IT), getting out of the office and alongside users, and studying ITIL which opened my eyes to the broader picture in business and IT - more than just my code.

*(A couple of other user-centric books are [Steve Krug’s “Don’t Make Me Think”][2], [37signals’ “Defensive Design for the Web"][3], and [Don Norman's classic "The Design of Everyday Things"][4])*
