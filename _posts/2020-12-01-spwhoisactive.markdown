There's lots of blog posts on how to use Adam Machanic's excellent (and free) "sp_WhoIsActive" script to view active connections to a SQL Server from <http://whoisactive.com>. I like Tara Kizer & Brent Ozar's no-nonsense approach to logging the results in a table at <https://www.brentozar.com/archive/2016/07/logging-activity-using-sp_whoisactive-take-2/> so much I use it almost as-is.

There's other ways to view active connections, what database they're connected to, the current SQL statement and more (for instance, Activity Monitor). But there's a definite advantage to being able to query and summarise these from a table using plain SQL.

I schedule the script below every 40 or so seconds to log the output from "sp_WhoIsActive" to a table, keeping data for the last 7 days. The script will create the table if it doesn't exist (but needs an existing database, I've used a database called "Scratch"). The script assumes that "sp_WhoIsActive" has been created in the `master` database.

The script typically takes less than a second to run, even on reasonably busy servers.

```sql
--get output from Adam Machanic's excellent "sp_WhoIsActive" script from http://whoisactive.com
--into logging table, should be scheduled every 30-60 seconds
--relies on sp_WhoIsActive stored proc being present in master database
--logging table hard-coded here to "WhoIsActive" table in Scratch database
--liberally borrowed from https://www.brentozar.com/archive/2016/07/logging-activity-using-sp_whoisactive-take-2/

SET NOCOUNT ON

```

As mentioned above, the benefit to having activity recorded for the last 7 days is being able to answer historical questions. While Query Store has replaced and surpassed queries I previously could have used "sp_WhoIsActive" for (for example, most frequently run queries, high CPU queries, high I/O queries), there's a couple of questions that are hard to answer any other way. I created/adapted the queries below over the years - more of these sorts of queries can be found at <http://whoisactive.com> documentation.

```sql
--which logins were most used in the last 7 days (counting unique login times)
SELECT TOP 10 [login_name], [count of distinct login time] = COUNT(DISTINCT [login_time])
FROM    [Scratch].dbo.[WhoIsActive] (READPAST)
GROUP BY [login_name]
ORDER BY 2 DESC

--were there any SHRINKFILEs (should not be, DBA-type task)
--will not catch all occurences of SHRINKFILE, only those running while data was collected
SELECT  *
FROM    [Scratch].dbo.[WhoIsActive] (READPAST)
WHERE   [sql_text] LIKE N'%SHRINKFILE%'

--tempdb allocations by query
--top queries are typically those that use temporary table variables
--sp_Blitz might show up here (as it is frequently run, and tempdb-heavy)
SELECT TOP 10 [sql_text], [database_name], [Sum of tempdb_allocations] = SUM([tempdb_allocations])
FROM    [Scratch].dbo.[WhoIsActive] (READPAST)
WHERE   [database_name] != N'tempdb'
GROUP BY [sql_text], [database_name]
ORDER BY 3 DESC

--blocked sessions, with blocking session details
;WITH BLOCKING AS (
 --blocking sessions
 SELECT DISTINCT [blocking_session_id], [collection_time]
 FROM    [Scratch].dbo.[WhoIsActive] (READPAST)
 WHERE   [blocking_session_id] IS NOT NULL
), BLOCKING_DETAILS AS (
 --get SQL text from blocking sessions at the same collection time
 SELECT DISTINCT BLOCKING.[blocking_session_id], W.[sql_text]
 FROM    [Scratch].dbo.[WhoIsActive] W (READPAST) INNER JOIN
             BLOCKING ON
                 W.[session_id] = BLOCKING.[blocking_session_id] AND
                 W.[collection_time] = BLOCKING.[collection_time]
 WHERE   W.[sql_text] IS NOT NULL
), BLOCKED AS (
 --blocked sessions
 --note may not have transaction start time, so use either transaction start time or collection time
 SELECT DISTINCT [session_id], [timing] = COALESCE([tran_start_time], [collection_time])
 FROM    [Scratch].dbo.[WhoIsActive] (READPAST)
 WHERE   [blocking_session_id] IS NOT NULL
 GROUP BY [session_id], COALESCE([tran_start_time], [collection_time])
)
SELECT  --blocked session
        W.[session_id], W.[sql_text], W.[login_name],
        --blocking session
        W.[blocking_session_id], [blocking_sql_text] = BLOCKING_DETAILS.[sql_text],
        W.[tran_start_time], W.[database_name], W.[collection_time]
FROM    [Scratch].dbo.[WhoIsActive] W (READPAST) INNER JOIN
            BLOCKED ON
                W.[session_id] = BLOCKED.[session_id] AND
                COALESCE(W.[tran_start_time], W.[collection_time]) = BLOCKED.[timing] LEFT OUTER JOIN
            BLOCKING_DETAILS ON
                W.[blocking_session_id] = BLOCKING_DETAILS.[blocking_session_id]
ORDER BY W.[session_id], COALESCE(W.[tran_start_time], W.[collection_time])
```
