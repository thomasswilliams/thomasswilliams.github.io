<h3>Roles</h3>
<dl>
  <dt>customer</dt>
  <dd>
    Knowing who your customers are is critical to knowing how to deliver value
    to those customers. It also helps when establishing support priorities - you
    may wish to spend more time documenting and writing procedures for customer-facing
    systems and services.
  </dd>
  <dt>DBA</dt>
  <dd>
    Database Administrator. Manage, as well as develop for, one or more database
    servers. May include SQL Server, MySQL, MariaDB, PostgreSQL, Oracle etc.
    This blog mainly deals with SQL Server. A couple of great definitions of
    what a DBA is and how they work can be found at:

  </dd>
  <dt>IT</dt>
  <dd>
    IT teams are increasingly called on to not just provide technology infrastructure, but
    to deliver and support technology <em>solutions</em> to help a business achieve its goals.
    They do this through <u>systems</u> and <u>services</u>.
  </dd>
  <dt>support staff</dt>
  <dd>
    IT teams work in many different ways. I use the term <em>support</em> to
    loosely mean IT or related teams that may be called on to fix production
    issues, in and out of normal hours. Support staff may include the DBA - but
    sometimes not.
  </dd>

<a name="database" id="database"></a>
<h3>Server- and database-specific</h3>
<dl>
  <dt>database</dt>
  <dd>
    A structured collection of data, organised for storage and querying. SQL
    Server and other <u><em>r</em></u>elational <u><em>d</em></u>ata<u><em>b</em></u>ase
    <u><em>m</em></u>anagement <u><em>s</em></u>ystems (RDBMS) organise into
    tables, views, stored procedures, functions, users etc.
  </dd>
  <dt>system database</dt>
  <dd>
    In SQL Server-speak, the <em>master</em>, <em>model</em>, <em>msdb</em> and
    <em>tempdb</em> databases. Can be ignored in queries by using a clause like
    <code>SELECT * FROM sys.databases WHERE database_id > 4</code>.
  </dd>
  <dt>database user</dt>
  <dd>
    In SQL Server, a person or group with a set of permissions relating to a
    database. Typically linked to a server-level login, but not always. Users
    may be members of a role like "database owner" or "read only". Users can be
    given specific permissions on tables (even down to the column level), views,
    stored procedures etc.
  </dd>
  <dt>DNS CNAME</dt>
  <dd>
    A DNS CNAME is an alias or redirect to point to a server or service. It
    can be used in place of a server or service when connecting - from any app,
    such as Windows Explorer, web browsers, SSMS etc. Using a DNS CNAME allows
    users to transparently connect to the server or service that the DNS CNAME
    points to, without being aware of the real location of the server or service.
    This adds opportunities like migrating the server or service, using cloud infrastructure,
    load balancing and "failing over" in case of issues. DNS CNAMEs are used every
    day in web browsers (<code>www.google.com</code> is a DNS CNAME, that points to
    the real server or service).
  </dd>
</dl>

<a name="concepts" id="concepts"></a>
<h3>Concepts</h3>
<dl>
  <dt>operations, operational</dt>
  <dd>
    Day-to-day, normal, "business as usual" (BAU), "keep the lights on"-type
    work to support "the business". As distinct from longer-term tactical and
    strategic work.
  </dd>
  <dt>issue</dt>
  <dd>
    A problem, something preventing normal work. May require analysis as to root
    cause. May require a timely fix or workaround. It's important to consider whether
    something's an "issue" from your customer's perspective.
  </dd>
  <dt>production</dt>
  <dd>
    A "live" environment, consisting of systems, services, networks, servers,
    authentication services etc. And databases. The opposite of
    <u>non-production</u>.
  </dd>
  <dt>non-production</dt>
  <dd>
    Covers all non-"live" environments, sometimes referred to as "test",
    "development", "staging", "user acceptance" etc. The opposite of
    <u>production</u>.
  </dd>
  <dt>system</dt>
  <dd>
    Software/application (which may include related hardware and other
    infrastructure), supported by IT teams, used by customers (internal
    and/or external). For instance, SQL Server, MS Access, Skype, Visual
    Studio, Confluence, Zendesk are all examples of systems. Ties in with
    ITIL "services", TOGAF (see <a href="https://www.opengroup.org/togaf">
    https://www.opengroup.org/togaf</a>) and other concepts like Wardley
    maps (see <a href="https://learnwardleymapping.com/">https://learnwardleymapping.com/</a>).
