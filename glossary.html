<h3>Roles</h3>
<dl>
  <dt>DBA</dt>
  <dd>
    Database Administrator. Manage, as well as develop for, one or more database
    servers. May include SQL Server, MySQL, MariaDB, PostgreSQL, Oracle etc.
    This blog mainly deals with SQL Server. A couple of great definitions of
    what a DBA is and how they work can be found at:

  </dd>
  <dt>support staff</dt>
  <dd>
    IT teams work in many different ways. I use the term <em>support</em> to
    loosely mean IT or related teams that may be called on to fix production
    issues, in and out of normal hours. Support staff may include the DBA - but
    sometimes not.

<a name="database" id="database"></a>
<h3>Server- and database-specific</h3>
<dl>
  <dt>database</dt>
  <dd>
    A structured collection of data, organised for storage and querying. SQL
    Server and other <u><em>r</em></u>elational <u><em>d</em></u>ata<u><em>b</em></u>ase 
    <u><em>m</em></u>anagement <u><em>s</em></u>ystems (RDBMS) organise into
    tables, views, stored procedures, functions, users etc.
  </dd>
  <dt>system database</dt>
  <dd>
    In SQL Server-speak, the <em>master</em>, <em>model</em>, <em>msdb</em>and
    <em>tempdb</em> databases. Can be ignored in queries by using a clause like
    <code>SELECT * FROM sys.databases WHERE database_id > 4</code>.
  </dd>
  <dt>database user</dt>
  <dd>
    In SQL Server, a person or group with a set of permissions relating to a
    database. Typically linked to a server-level login, but not always. Users
    may be members of a role like "database owner" or "read only". Users can be
    given specific permissions on tables (even down to the column level), views,
    stored procedures etc.
  </dd>
</dl>

<a name="concepts" id="concepts"></a>
<h3>Concepts</h3>
<dl>
  <dt>operations, operational</dt>
  <dd>
    Day-to-day, normal, "keep the lights on"-type work to support "the
    business". As distinct from longer-term tactical and strategic work.
  </dd>
  <dt>issue</dt>
  <dd>
    A problem, something preventing normal work. May require analysis as to root
    cause. May require a timely fix or workaround. It's important to consider whether
    something's an "issue" from your customer's perspective.
  </dd>
  <dt>production</dt>
  <dd>
    A "live" environment, consisting of networks, servers, applications,
    authentication services etc. And databases. The opposite of
    <u>non-production</u>.
  </dd>
  <dt>non-production</dt>
  <dd>
    Covers all non-"live" environments, sometimes referred to as "test",
    "development", "staging", "user acceptance" etc. The opposite of
    <u>production</u>.
  </dd>
